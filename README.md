# Big Finish Boxset Generator - App Version

### [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) App built with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

I built a React JS web version of this app in 2023 and hosted it on Surge. It is now on my [website](https://andrewblair.co.uk/apps/big-finish-generator). 

I learned how to use React Social Share and it works as intended, but otherwise was never fully happy with the layout. The layout wasn't quite right, especially on a laptop, but the responsive mobile version needs tweaks too.

After making a new version of [my Eurovision Bingo app](https://github.com/aagb1884/EuroBingoAppExpo) I wanted to try another app; partly as practice but also because after I'd spent that much money signing up for iOS and Google Play developer accounts I didn't want to have just one app up there. The app is still in the build and testing phase but it's looking and working a lot better. [React Native's Share](https://reactnative.dev/docs/share) feature is much more streamlined and easier to add than the React JS Social Share, with one button rather than many. 

## Deployment

You will need to have [Expo] installed, and for it to work you will also need [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and (if you're on Mac or Linux) [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall). Clone this repo. You can then install Expo Go on a mobile device and test the app that way.
